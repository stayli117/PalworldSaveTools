## Overview

<img src="https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?lines=What+exactly+is+this+thing%3F;Your+save%2C+your+way;One+tool+to+rule+them+all&center=true&width=490&height=28&font=monospace&size=22&color=7DD3FC&vCenter=true" alt="" />

</div>

Palworld Save Tools (PST) is a fast, all-in-one desktop application for inspecting and editing Palworld save files. Built with Python and PySide6, it reads and writes the game's compressed save format directly — no game mods required.

Whether you need to manage a dedicated server, migrate between co-op and dedicated servers, clean up abandoned data, or fine-tune individual Pals, PST provides a single unified interface for all of it.

### Highlights

- **Cross-platform** — Pre-built binaries for **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**.
- **Fast native parsing** — One of the quickest save file readers available, powered by the [`palsav`](src/palsav) engine.
- **Visual map** — Interactive world map with base/player markers, exclusion zones, and coordinate calibration.
- **Deep Pal editing** — Full control over stats, IVs, souls, skills, passives, work suitabilities, rank, and appearance flags.
- **Server-grade tooling** — Bulk deletion, cleanup, conversion, and character transfer built for administrators.
- **Automatic backups** — Every save operation creates a backup before writing.
- **9 languages** — Localized UI, in-app guides, and documentation.

## Installation

<img src="https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?lines=Get+it+running+in+minutes;Download+and+go;No+setup+required&center=true&width=420&height=28&font=monospace&size=22&color=7DD3FC&vCenter=true" alt="" />

</div>

### Standalone Builds (Recommended)

Pre-built binaries are available for all three major platforms from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/deafdudecomputers/PalworldSaveTools/releases/latest):

| Platform | Download | Requirements |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Windows** | `PalworldSaveTools-*.exe` | Windows 10/11, [VC++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) (2015–2022) |
| **Linux** | `PalworldSaveTools-*-linux` | Any modern distro |
| **macOS** | `PalworldSaveTools-*-macos.dmg` | macOS 12+ (Monterey or later) |

Also available on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/mods/3190).

1. Download the appropriate build for your platform.
2. Extract (if archived) and run the executable.
3. That's it — no Python or dependencies needed.

> **Windows:** If you see "VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found," install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170).

> **Linux:** You may need to mark the file executable: `chmod +x PalworldSaveTools-*-linux`

> **macOS:** If Gatekeeper blocks the app, right-click → **Open** the first time, or run `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/app`.

### From Source (All Platforms)

PST uses [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management. The start script automatically creates a virtual environment and installs everything.

**Prerequisites:** [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/) and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deafdudecomputers/PalworldSaveTools.git
cd PalworldSaveTools
uv run start.py
```

**Windows** (double-click launcher):
```
start.cmd
```

The launcher creates a `.venv`, installs dependencies via `uv sync`, and boots the app. It cleans up the lockfile on exit so each run is reproducible.

</div>

### Save File Locations

**Host / Co-op (Windows):**
```
%localappdata%\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\YOURID\RANDOMID\
```

**Dedicated Server:**
```
steamapps\common\Palworld\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\0\RANDOMSERVERID\
```

### Map Unlock

PST can unlock the full map (all fast-travel points) for your save:

1. Load your save in PST.
2. Open the **Player Inventory** tab and click **Unlock All Map + Fast Travel** for a single player, **or**
3. Use the **Restore Map** tool in the Tools tab to apply unlocked map progress across **all** your worlds/servers at once.
4. Save changes. Automatic backups are created.

### Host → Server Transfer

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

1. Copy `Level.sav` and the `Players` folder from your host save.
2. Paste them into the dedicated server save folder.
3. Start the server, create a new character, and wait for an auto-save.
4. Close the server.
5. Use **Fix Host Save** in PST to migrate the old character's GUID to the new one.
6. Copy files back and launch the server.

</details>

### Host Swap (Changing Host)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand host swap guide</summary>

**Background:**

- The host uses `0001.sav`.
- Each client uses a unique regular UID save, such as `1234.sav`, `9876.sav`, etc.
- Player A is the old host with progress in `0001.sav`.
- Player B is an existing client who will become the new host.

**Starting State:**
```
0001.sav = Player A, old host
1234.sav = Player B, future host
```

**Prerequisites:**
- Player B must have previously joined Player A's world and created a character.
- Player B's regular player save must exist in the `Players` folder.
- Player A and Player B must both be at least Level 2.
- Back up the entire world-save folder before making changes.
- Shut down the server or close Palworld before modifying the save.

---

### 1. Swap Player B Into the Host Slot

Open **Fix Host Save** and select:
```
Source Player: Player A, 0001.sav
Target Player: Player B, 1234.sav
```
Run the migration.

Result:
```
0001.sav = Player B's original progress
1234.sav = Player A's original progress
```
Player B now occupies the host slot. Player A's original host progress is preserved in Player B's former regular UID.

---

### 2. Start the World With Player B as the New Host

Start Palworld with Player B hosting the world. Confirm Player B has the correct character, level, inventory, pals, guild, bases, and ownership.

Save state:
```
0001.sav = Player B, new host
1234.sav = Player A's original progress
```

---

### 3. Have Player A Join Player B's World

Player A joins the world now hosted by Player B. Palworld may assign Player A a new regular UID because they are no longer the host.

Example:
```
3456.sav = Player A's new client UID
```

Palworld may ask Player A to create a new character (expected). Player A's original progress is still at `1234.sav`.

After Player A creates the temporary character:
```
0001.sav = Player B's correct progress
1234.sav = Player A's original progress
3456.sav = Player A's new temporary character
```

---

### 4. Level Player A's Temporary Character

1. Have Player A reach at least **Level 2** with the temporary character.
2. Have Player A leave the server.
3. Shut down the server completely.
4. Back up the world-save folder again.

Level 2 is required because **Fix Host Save** requires both selected characters to be at least Level 2.

---

### 5. Restore Player A's Original Progress

Open **Fix Host Save** again and select:
```
Source Player: Player A's original progress, 1234.sav
Target Player: Player A's new client UID, 3456.sav
```
Run the migration. Because this is another two-way swap:

```
0001.sav = Player B's correct host progress
3456.sav = Player A's restored original progress
1234.sav = Player A's temporary character
```
Player A's new client UID now points to Player A's original character and progress.

---

### Final Result:
```
0001.sav = Player B, new host with original progress
3456.sav = Player A, client with restored original progress
1234.sav = Temporary leftover character
```
- Player B hosts using Player B's original character.
- Player A joins using Player A's restored original character.

</details>

### Character Transfer (Cross-Save)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

Transfer characters between different worlds or servers while preserving characters, Pals, inventory, and technology:

1. Open the **Character Transfer** tool from the Tools tab.
2. Select the source save and target save.

## Troubleshooting

<img src="https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?lines=When+things+go+sideways;Don%27t+panic;We%27ve+seen+it+all&center=true&width=390&height=28&font=monospace&size=22&color=7DD3FC&vCenter=true" alt="" />

</div>

### "VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found" (Windows)

Install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) (2015–2022).

### `struct.error` when parsing a save

The save file format is outdated. Load the save in-game (Solo, Co-op, or Dedicated Server) once to trigger an automatic structure update, then try again. Ensure the save was updated on or after the latest game patch.

### GamePass converter not working

1. Fully close the GamePass version of Palworld.
2. Wait a few minutes for file handles to release.
3. Run the GamePass → Steam converter.
4. Launch Palworld on GamePass to verify.

### Linux / macOS binary won't launch

- **Linux:** `chmod +x PalworldSaveTools-*-linux` to mark it executable.
- **macOS:** If blocked by Gatekeeper, right-click → **Open**, or run `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/app`.

## Building from Source

<img src="https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?lines=Compile+it+yourself;Build+your+own;From+source+to+binary&center=true&width=340&height=28&font=monospace&size=22&color=7DD3FC&vCenter=true" alt="" />

</div>

PST supports two build paths. The CI/CD pipeline uses Nuitka for cross-platform release binaries; cx_Freeze is used for the local Windows installer.

### Nuitka (Cross-Platform — Used by CI/Releases)

Requires Python 3.11+ and `uv`. Nuitka is installed automatically.

```bash
# One-file build (Windows / Linux)
uv run python build/nuitka/build_nuitka.py --onefile

# One-directory build (macOS .app)
uv run python build/nuitka/build_nuitka.py --onedir
```

Outputs go to `dist/`:
- Windows → `dist/PalworldSaveTools-*.exe`
- Linux → `dist/PalworldSaveTools-*-linux`
- macOS → `dist/PalworldSaveTools.app` → packaged as `.dmg`

### cx_Freeze (Windows Installer)

For a local Windows `.7z` package:

```
scripts\build_cx.cmd
```

This creates `PST_standalone_v{version}.7z` in the project root.

### Interactive Builder

An interactive menu to pick a build mode:

```bash
uv run python build/build_interactively.py
```

## The Palworld Team

<img src="https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?lines=The+people+behind+the+magic;Meet+the+team;Built+with+passion&center=true&width=420&height=28&font=monospace&size=22&color=7DD3FC&vCenter=true" alt="" />

</div>

This project wouldn't exist without the people behind it.

### Active Maintainers

**[Pylar](https://github.com/deafdudecomputers)** — The man who started it all. Every line of this tool traces back to his vision and relentless work on the save engine, the GUI, and the features you use every day.

**[cyrix](https://github.com/CyrixJD115)** — Refactorer and sub-maintainer. Focused on code quality, simplification, and structural improvements — keeping the codebase clean, smaller, and easier to maintain as the project grows.

### Contributors

**[dkoz](https://github.com/dkoz)** — The man behind the IDs. Provides game data IDs, structural insight on the ID codes, and the deep knowledge of how Palworld's data is wired together that keeps the tool accurate with every game update.

**[oMaN-Rod](https://github.com/oMaN-Rod)** — Provided the original save parser that this project forked from. Without his foundational work on cracking the Palworld save format, none of this would exist. The fork streamlined and simplified his parser into what PST is today.

**[Okaetsu](https://github.com/Okaetsu)** — Modding insights that made base import/export possible. His understanding of how Palworld structures base data from the modding side bridged the gap between modding and save editing, making this feature a reality.
