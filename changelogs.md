#2.2.0
- **NPC names now resolve correctly** — generic NPCs (Male_Trader01 variants, Believer_Bat, Hunter_Rifle, etc.) now show proper in-game names like "Villager", "Butcher in Training", "Free Pal Alliance Believer", and "Syndicate Gunner" instead of technical asset names. The game data updater was only looking up `NAME_{npc_id}` directly in the localization table, missing the indirect `OverrideNameTextID` path from `DT_PalHumanParameter.json`. 154 NPCs fixed.
- Bumped version to 2.2.0

#2.1.9
- **Clear XGP Fog no longer crashes when Steam save path doesn't exist** — the Game Pass fog clearing button now directly clears fog on the extracted save instead of calling the Steam-focused batch function, which crashed with a file-not-found error on Game Pass-only systems.
- **DPI scaling fixed for Mac and small screens** — window size now adapts to screen geometry (1280×800 to 4K) instead of a hardcoded 1448×800. `QT_SCALE_FACTOR_ROUNDING_POLICY=PassThrough` only applies on macOS to avoid blurry fractional scaling on Windows.
- **README features summary table** — a compact overview table at the top of the Features section so new visitors can quickly see what the tool does without reading 80+ bullet points. Added to all 9 language versions.
- Bumped version to 2.1.9

#2.1.8
- **Fix Illegal Pals now fixes >3 active skills** — the fix function was trimming passive skills and all other illegal stats but skipped `EquipWaza` entirely. Pals with more than 3 active skills are now correctly clamped to the top 3.
- **Character Transfer no longer loses technology and recipes** — player save data is now fully copied from source to target with identity fields patched in place. Previously only a subset of keys was transferred, missing unlocked recipes, technology data, capture records, and exploration progress.
- **Save Changes in Character Transfer no longer triggers false "unsaved changes" warning** — clicking Save Changes then closing the dialog no longer asks if you want to save. The dirty-flag tracking is now properly cleared after a successful save.
- **Level-2 requirement removed from Character Transfer and Fix Host Save** — both tools no longer block level-1 players from being selected or processed. Useful for testing and fresh characters.
- **Level editing in Stats tab works for fresh characters** — players without an existing Level field (new/level-1 characters) can now have their level changed without silently breaking the save. The GVAS serializer was crashing on the missing property type metadata, causing File > Save Changes to appear successful while writing nothing. Also fixed the same bug in the Exp field and StatusPoint creation.
- **Fix Illegal Pals dialog redesigned** — two-column layout with player/guild checkboxes on the left and per-pal detail rows (species icon, name, level, IVs, souls, location) on the right. Click a player to view their illegal pals. Base workers now display guild name and resolved base ID, and are scoped per base for targeted fixing.
- Bumped version to 2.1.8

#2.1.7
- **Unsaved changes warning on exit** — if you've edited the save and try to close the app, a dialog asks if you want to save first. Yes saves, No discards, Cancel stays in the app.
- **Stale save detection** — if Level.sav was modified on disk (e.g. the game/server re-saved it) since you loaded it, a warning appears before overwriting those changes with your in-memory edits.
- **Stale save detection for standalone tools** — Character Transfer, Fix Host Save, and Slot Injector now also warn if the target Level.sav changed on disk since load.
- **Unsaved changes warning for Character Transfer** — closing the Character Transfer dialog after transfers (without saving) prompts Save/Don't Save/Cancel.
- **Drop .sav anywhere on the window** — drag-and-drop a save file onto any tab (not just the Tools tab) to load it. A visual overlay confirms the drop zone.
- **Save button translations** — Yes/No/Cancel in unsaved-changes dialogs now use translated text (button.save / button.dont_save / button.cancel).
- **Portuguese (Portugal) translation** — added full pt_PT language support, contributed by sirj0k3r. Selectable from the menu under Languages. The existing Brazilian Portuguese label is now disambiguated as "Português (Brasil)".
- **Selection colors unified** — multi-select and single-select now use the same accent color everywhere: pal editor slots, player inventory, base inventory lists, tree widgets, picker lists, and dropdown menus. No more mismatched blue shades.
- **Error overlay replaces popup dialogs** — errors now appear as a dark overlay on the main window (matching the loading screen style) instead of a separate popup window. Consistent look, no more floating dialogs.
- **Removed stale GamingServices warning** — the "Stop Xbox Gaming Services" confirmation no longer shows during Steam→GamePass conversion. The service stop/restart was already removed, but the dialog was still asking about it.
- **Multi-select in pal editor, player inventory, and guild/base inventory** — Ctrl+click to select multiple pals or items, Shift+click for range selection. Bulk actions appear in an inline toolbar: Max/Heal/Rename/Delete for pals, Delete/Clear Qty for items. Selection persists across palbox page navigation. Themed rename dialog for bulk pal renaming.
- **Cross-family structure replacement** — the Replace Structures dialog now has a "Show all structure types" toggle. When enabled, you can replace any building with any other building type (e.g. a wall with a fence). Off by default, only same-family variants shown.
- Bumped version to 2.1.7

#2.1.6
- **Bulk Rename and Bulk Restore now show pal icons** — the pal selection lists in both dialogs display a 20x20 pal icon next to each entry, matching Bulk Sync, Bulk Clone, and Bulk Delete.
- **Auto-reset save session on tool launch** — clicking any standalone tool (character transfer, slot injector, fix host save, modify save, convert, restore map, etc.) while a save is loaded now wipes the session clean. Prevents the common confusion where users expect the save loaded in main to carry into tools that prompt for their own save file.
- **Character Transfer null-safety guards** — Transfer All and Save Changes now check that source/target saves are loaded before running. Shows a clear warning instead of crashing with `AttributeError` when called with no save data.
- **Main window hides during tool dialogs** — character transfer, slot injector, fix host save, and all other external tools now hide the main window while open. No more loading overlays attaching to the wrong window. The main window reappears automatically when the tool closes.
- **Loading overlay now works inside tool dialogs** — save loading and other heavy operations inside tool dialogs show the loading overlay on the correct window instead of the (hidden) main window.
- **App no longer quits when closing a tool dialog** — fixed a regression where closing the last visible window caused the entire application to exit.
- **Fix Illegal Players** — new menu function that scans all players for hero stats (HP, Stamina, Attack, Work Speed, Weight) exceeding the 50-point cap. Shows a per-player selection dialog with which stats are illegal, and caps them back to 50 on fix. Same UI pattern as Fix Illegal Pals.
- **Loading screen redesigned** — the loading overlay is now a built-in part of the main window instead of a separate popup. Moves and resizes with the window, no longer blocks interaction with other applications. Configs > Loading Screen Configs submenu with Show/Hide options. Hide mode shows a spinner in the header bar instead of the overlay.
- **Menu restructured** — Functions menu now grouped into Delete / Fix / Reset / Misc subcategories. Removed redundant labels (Remove→Delete, Repair→Fix). Restore All Pals + Fix Unassigned Pals merged into single Fix All Pals. Fix All Guilds replaces Rebuild All Guilds. All submenus match the main menu styling.
- **Bulk sync same species now copies work suitabilities** — syncing a pal to others of the same species also transfers work suitability ranks. Bulk sync all (cross-species) still preserves each pal's natural suitabilities.
- **Added translations for missing keys** — common.confirm and various other keys now translated across all 8 languages.
- **Fixed player selection not working for names starting with `--`** — the popup list was treating any name starting with `--` as the "clear" marker, preventing players like `--Sasok--` from being selected. Same fix applied to skill picker dialog.
- **Fix Host Save search crash** — the search boxes in Fix Host Save no longer crash with `AttributeError: 'QTreeWidget' object has no attribute 'original_items'` when no save is loaded yet. Guards added to skip filtering until player data is populated.
- Bumped version to 2.1.6

#2.1.5
- **Character Transfer no longer corrupts breeding eggs** — egg pal data (character_id, stats, passives) is now properly preserved. The inventory transfer no longer overwrites eggs with blank entries, and dynamic item merging appends source entries instead of rebuilding the entire list (which silently dropped entries with zero/empty IDs). Repair All Items also detects eggs by their `PalEgg_` prefix when game metadata is incomplete.
- **Wiki tab sort improvements** — the pals category in the built-in wiki now defaults to sorting by Paldeck number. Unknown/unlisted pals sort to the bottom instead of showing at index 0. Sort toggle behavior changed: clicking an active sort button now reverses direction instead of clearing the sort, matching typical list behavior.
- **Player level shows 1 instead of ?** — players who never leveled up now display as level 1 everywhere instead of a confusing `?` in hover overlays, map markers, guild lists, and export data.
- **PalDefender coordinates fixed** — `killnearestbase` commands were using wrong coordinates, making them destroy the wrong bases. Now correctly targets the bases you selected.
- **Language switching fixed** — changing language now switches to the correct language on the first try, with all labels and tooltips updating immediately.
- **Tooltips now update on language switch** — the Max All Souls and Max All IVs icons in the pal editor now show translated tooltips when changing the UI language on the fly.
- **Language names in menu always show native names** — Portuguese, Chinese, Russian, and all other languages in the menu > Languages list now display in their native form (e.g. "Português") regardless of the current app language.
- **Unlock All Fast Travel** — renamed from "Unlock All Map + Fast Travel". Now only unlocks fast travel points without revealing map areas or unlocking the world map.
- **Loading overlay close button** — the loading screen now has a ✕ close button in the top-right corner. Clicking it dismisses the overlay while background work continues.
- **Add All Key Items performance fix** — massive speedup on big saves. Each item was triggering a full scan of every container in the save file; now all items are added in memory and saved once. Same fix applied to Bulk Add Items and Equipment Loadouts.
- **Stats tab now refreshes all tabs on change** — changing stats (level +/-, max all stats, stat point edits) now triggers a full UI refresh so all tabs show up-to-date data immediately. Max All Stats previously bypassed the refresh signal; now it uses the same path as manual edits.
- **Character Transfer performance fixes** — Transfer All no longer calls save() per inventory item (same O(n) fix as Add All Key Items). Dynamic container GUID remapping changed from triple-nested scan to O(1) lookup. Save Changes now writes player files in parallel using all CPU cores, drastically reducing save time after bulk transfers.
- **General performance sweep** — fixed inefficient scans across 10+ files:
  - `modify_container_slots`: triple-nested loop → O(1) container lookup
  - `get_base_worker_pals`, `remove_structure_from_guilds`, `_clear_pal_booth_slots`, map reassign: char_map linear search per slot → pre-built instance dict
  - `load_game_data_map`: added caching (was re-reading JSON 27 times)
  - `_load_boss_key_map`: added caching (was reading disk every call)
  - `add_item_to_players`: moved container_lookup build outside per-player loop
  - `scan_illegal_pals`, `fix_illegal_pals`: merged double char_map scans into single pass
  - `get_player_info_from_save`: merged duplicate guild_map iterations
  - `_apply_to_containers`: consolidated per-container char_map scans into one pass
  - `_cleanup_excess_slots`: merged 3 char_map scans + fixed O(N²) container lookup
  - `fix_host_save.py`: merged `_build_level_map` + `_build_pal_count_map`, cached player level scans, deduplicated player list builders
  - Deduplicated `build_player_levels`, `count_owned_pals`, `_delete_pal_at_slot`
- Bumped version to 2.1.5

#2.1.4
- **Guild member roles** — right-click a guild member to set their role: Guild Master, Submaster, Member, or Guest. Promoting to Guild Master reassigns admin to the target and demotes the old leader to Submaster. Role column visible in the guild members list.
- **Export base crash fixed** — exporting a single base from the guild tree list no longer crashes with `UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'file_path'`. The `task()` closure now correctly captures the outer `file_path` via `nonlocal`.
- **Inventory tab crash on startup fixed** — loading a save on a fresh profile no longer crashes with `IndexError: list index out of range` in `_update_level_display`. The EXP table fallback was padded to 80 entries, and the level guard now checks against table length instead of hardcoded 80.
- **Technology points auto-save** — Technology Points and Ancient Technology Points spinners now save to the player `.sav` file immediately on change, no need to click Apply. Max All Stats also saves these values.
- **Max All Stats loading fix** — the "Max All Stats" button no longer causes an infinite loading screen. The full save reload cascade was removed since the UI already updates synchronously.
- **Max All Stats saving fix** — Level.sav stats, TP, and ATP all saved correctly when using Max All Stats. Data loss on player switch after Max All Stats is fixed.
- **Pal editor soul/IV quick-max** — the souls and IV icons in the pal info panel are now clickable buttons that max all souls or all IVs at once, with proper hover styling and tooltips.
- **Windows builds now use cx_Freeze** — replaced Nuitka .exe with cx_Freeze standalone .7z archive. Build time dropped from ~15min to ~2min. No more false-positive antivirus flags on VirusTotal.
- **Release notes simplified** — removed multi-language changelog from releases. English-only changelog extracted directly from `changelogs.md`.
- **New test workflow** — `Test cx_Freeze Standalone Build` workflow for isolated standalone testing with draft releases.
- Bumped version to 2.1.4

#2.1.3
- **Portuguese (Brazil) translations** — added full Brazilian Portuguese language support. All 2171 UI strings translated. Selectable from the menu under Languages.
- **READMEs updated** — added Cheat Mode, Export/Import `.pstpal`, Base Change Coordinates, Base Nudge, and other missing features to all 9 README translations.
- **Loading screen overhaul** — the loading screen can no longer hang or get stuck. Completely rewrote the animation system — it now runs in its own background process, so even if a save operation takes long, the loading window stays smooth and responsive.
- **Loading screens added to more tools** — Convert Save Files, Restore Map (both Steam and GamePass), and the Player Inventory Max All Stats button now show a loading screen during heavy work instead of freezing up.
- **Nested loading conflict fixed** — using menu functions like Max All Pals while the Pal Editor is open no longer spawns multiple overlapping loading screens that break the UI.
- **Lazy tab crash fix** — menu operations no longer crash when you haven't visited certain tabs yet. The app skips cache updates on tabs that haven't been opened, and those tabs load fresh data when you first visit them.
- **Pal editor toggle tooltips** — all toggle buttons in the info panel (Gender, Predator, Boss, Lucky, and more) now show helpful tooltips on hover, translated into all supported languages.
- **Backup now includes more save files** — automatic backups also save WorldOption.sav and LocalData.sav, not just Level.sav and players. Backup folders inside your save are automatically skipped.
- **Game version tooltip** — hovering over the game version label in the header shows the current Palworld version, in all languages.
- **Stream support in palsav json_tools** — save files can now be read and written directly from memory streams, not just file paths. By msansen.
- **Load from Backup** — new File menu option that lists all your auto-backups with timestamp, world name, and player count, so you can easily restore any previous save state.
- **Cheat mode condensed stars capped** — the condenser rank (stars) is now limited to 5 even in cheat mode, since higher values cause glitches in-game. Cheat mode still unlocks other caps like IVs, souls, and level.
- **Map viewer base actions enhanced** — every base operation (delete, export, clone, radius, reassign, move, nudge) now zooms to the base with a glow effect before executing, and plays a pulsing sparkle animation on completion. Clone Base is now also available from the tree list right-click menu.
- **Bulk Sync no longer forces work suitability to 10** — syncing stats from a source pal to others no longer overwrites each target's work suitability to the maximum. Each pal keeps its own unique work suitability unchanged.
- Bumped version to 2.1.3

#2.1.2
- **DPS loading speedup** — `RawData` field inside `SaveParameterArray.SaveParameter` now uses skip-decode in GUI path. Saves ~19ms + ~27MB memory for 9600-pal DPS files. Pal editor still accesses all 30+ other fields normally (CharacterID, Level, PassiveSkillList, talents, etc.). Bottleneck identified: remaining ~400-700ms is `properties_until_end` called 9600× per file — a custom batch decoder would be needed for sub-200ms load times.
- **Restore Map fix** — tool now reads the real Steam/macOS save path (`%LOCALAPPDATA%/Pal/Saved/SaveGames`) instead of the config `last_save_path`, so it finds your actual save folders again. Also handles flat save directories (LocalData.sav in root) in addition to the nested Steam structure
- **Convert Save files fix** — no longer hangs or silently fails; work runs directly instead of through a daemon thread that never starts inside `QEventLoop.exec()`
- **Tab switching performance** — navigating to a lazy-loaded tab no longer refreshes every single tab; only the target tab repopulates. Removed a redundant double-refresh of the base inventory tab on save load
- **macOS trackpad phantom scroll fix** — right-clicking (two-finger tap) on empty grid space in pal editor or base inventory no longer kicks you back pages. Zero-delta scroll events from macOS gesture synthesis now pass through instead of triggering page navigation
- **Linux save path support** — `get_steam_save_path()` now resolves Proton save location (`~/.local/share/Steam/.../SaveGames`). Restore Map works on all 3 platforms
- **Loading overlay on player select** — selecting a player in Player Inventory or Pal Editor now shows the animated loading overlay for the entire operation: both tabs' data (inventory + pals) load simultaneously in the background, then both UIs update at once when the overlay dismisses. Cross-tab player selection sync is instant and works on first use (Player Inventory and Pal Editor tabs are no longer lazily deferred).
- **DPS button visibility** — the DPS mode button in Pal Editor now only shows when the selected player actually has a DPS save file. No more clicking a useless button
- **Loading overlay on base import/export/clone** — importing, exporting, and cloning bases now shows the animated loading overlay instead of a frozen wait cursor. Single-base export, bulk guild export, and multi-file import all wrapped with background progress.
- **Clone base in map viewer** — right-click any base marker and pick "Clone Base" to duplicate it in the same guild with the loading overlay. The clone spawns near the original.
- **Loading overlay on XGP save load** — the entire GamePass save extraction and decoding now runs under the animated overlay instead of freezing the UI during container blob reads.
- **GamePass save error dialogs** — the save picker and Steam↔GamePass converter now show clear error dialogs when no saves are found or saves can't be parsed, with suggestions to log into the world on Xbox Game Pass and update to the latest Palworld version.
- **Bulk Clone/Delete pals** — new "Bulk Clone" and "Bulk Delete" buttons in the Pal Editor header. Opens a species-picker dialog with Party/Palbox/DPS source toggles, search, and per-species quantity (clone) or select-all (delete). Clone mode shows available free slots and caps copies accordingly. Both operations run under the loading overlay.
- Bumped version to 2.1.2

#2.1.1
- **Character Transfer: dynamic data loss fix** — restored 3 orphaned fixes from `feat/av-hardened-nuitka-build` that were never merged to main. Container slots now scan both `ItemContainerSaveData` and `CharacterContainerSaveData` for in-use dynamic IDs before merging. Session-level dedup prevents duplicate entries on repeated transfers. ID remapping accumulates across multi-player sessions so slot references stay consistent. When a source dynamic ID collides with an in-use target ID, a new unique ID is generated and all container slot references are rewritten to match
- **Repair All Items** — menu function that regenerates all weapons, armor, and eggs across every container (player inventories, base chests, guild storage, etc.) with fresh IDs and max durability. Fixes corrupted durability data, missing dynamic entries, or any item that needs a full refresh
- **NPC/pal discrimination fix** — monster-row-based pal detection; NPCs no longer leak into pal pickers, breeding lists, or pal search/delete dialogs. Pal pickers source from `_PALMAP` instead of `_NAMEMAP` so generic Human/NPC templates are excluded
- **Breeding picker cleanup** — candidates sourced directly from `breedingdata.json` pal_info instead of merged npc list. Manual prefix/otomo/zukan-index dedup heuristics removed (superseded by game data)
- **Convert SteamID dialog** — starts empty instead of auto-fetching; no stale data shown before user action
- **Flamethrower gear fix** — items with empty descriptions now show correctly in pickers (no longer hidden)
- **DPS delete fix** — deleting a pal from DPS storage no longer causes infinite loading in-game. Slot data is fully cleared so the game correctly treats it as empty
- Bumped version to 2.1.1

#2.1.0
- **Faster startup** — app now loads ~2–4s faster by deferring heavy modules until needed. Language files load on demand, unused engine modules skip import, and non-visible tabs are created only when you navigate to them
- **Sidebar collapse/expand** — collapse shows icons only, expand reveals labels. Toggle button at top (>>/<<). State persists across sessions
- **Stats editor revamped** — hero stats (Health, Stamina, Attack, Work Speed, Weight) now show correct in-game computed values, capped at 50 points, with a "Max All Stats" button. Relic abilities integrated into the same tab. Defense stat now editable
- **Weight formula fix** — carry weight now calculates correctly using the game's real formula
- **Base move on map** — right-click a base marker, pick "Change Coordinates", then click any spot on the map to teleport the base. Warning dialog explains collision/terrain/AI risks
- **Base nudge** — nudge a base by exact X/Y/Z offsets to fix ground clipping or floating without needing to re-place it
- **Export/Import Pals** — right-click any pal to export as `.pstpal` (compressed) or `.json`. Import into empty slots in party, palbox, DPS, or base worker slots. Works across saves and players
- **Player context menu cleanup** — removed Edit Player Stats and Edit Tech Points (now handled in the Stats tab)
- **New translations** — player stat labels added to all 8 languages
- Bumped version to 2.1.0

#2.0.9
- Updated game data to palworld v1.0.1
- **Breeding formula fixes** — case-insensitive name/tribe mapping prevents missed pal parents; pals produced by unique breeding combos are excluded from the generic formula's candidate pool; `closest_pal()` tiebreaker picks higher combi-rank instead of rarity
- **macOS save path support** — new `get_steam_save_path()` resolves Steam saves on Windows (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pal\Saved\SaveGames`) and macOS (`~/Library/Containers/com.pocketpair.palworld.mac/.../SaveGames`); `get_preferred_save_path()` persists last-used directory across sessions in user config; `restore_map.py` no longer crashes on non-Windows
- Bumped version to 2.0.9

#2.0.8
- **Fixed `LocalData.sav` parsing** — `PalLocalWorldSaveGame` saves now load correctly (fixes parser under-consumption that skipped subsequent properties)
- **Bulk Sync (All Pals)** — sync stats/IVs/skills from any pal to all others across Party/Palbox/DPS. Work suitabilities are no longer copied cross-pal — each target keeps its natural suitabilities maxed to 10
- **Guild data fix** — `_u8_flag` → `role` migration prevents silent data loss on save
- **Fix Illegal Pals dialog** — per-player illegal pal counts, player selection, loading overlay, Select All/Deselect All
- **Restore Map** — also clears sky island cloud overlay so revealed map is fully visible
- **Fixed system32 crash** — all relative paths replaced with proper app data resolution; settings no longer lost in Nuitka onefile builds on restart
- **Open Data Folder** — menu item under AIO Tools opens app data directory in file manager
- **Removed auto-update** — kept version check + GitHub chip pulse; click still opens releases page
- **Work suitability icons** — fixed stale icon bug that let users inject illegal work suitabilities into any pal
- Bumped version to 2.0.8

#2.0.7
- **Per-item quantity cap** — non-stackable items (max_stack=1) stay limited to 1; all stackables uncapped to 999,999,999. Uses `max_stack` from generated game data
- **track user.cfg** — removed from `.gitignore`, now version-controlled
- **Abilities panel in Stats tab** — right side of Stats tab now shows relic abilities with toggles, icons, current values, and spinners. Supports edit and apply per player. Retranslates on language change
- **Translations: abilities keys** — added `inventory.abilities`, `inventory.abilities_apply`, `inventory.abilities_loaded`, `inventory.abilities_no_player_selected` in all 8 languages
- **NPC database expanded** — `update_npc_data()` now loads regular NPCs from `DT_PalCharacterIconDataTable.json` (not just boss NPCs). NPC count 33 → 369. Ammo Merchant and all trader/civilian variants now in DB
- **Sort no longer merges** — `_consolidate_container_slots` now just reorders by category/name. No stacking, no 9999 cap, gold and all items left untouched
- **Predator toggle** — paw icon button in pal editor info panel. Toggles `PREDATOR_` prefix. Filter toggle in Add New Pal and Bulk Pal Management dialogs. Red paw badge on thumbnail cards
- **Cheat mode** — bug icon toggle expands all caps to 255: level, IVs, souls, condenser rank, active skills (3→255), passive skills (4→255). Duplicate skills allowed, learnset bypassed. Skill pagination with mouse wheel scroll (3/page active, 4/page passive)
- **Max All Pals** — all 3 locations (pal editor, base inventory, menu→Functions) respect cheat mode caps. Double confirm dialog for menu version
- **Skill name fixes** — case-insensitive l10n lookup fixes "Thunder Rail" (was `Railbolt`). Partner skill names resolved from pal data
- **Add New Pal filter** — all filters removed: shows every entry in `_NAMEMAP`. Standard/Predator/Boss toggles all default to on
- Bumped version to 2.0.7
- **Bumped version to 2.0.7**

#2.0.6
- **Effigies now display in key items grid** — read from player `.sav` `RelicPossessNumMap` (bounty-token pattern)
- Edit/delete effigy count writes directly to `RelicPossessNumMap` (spendable at Statue of Power in-game)
- Add All Key Items prompts for effigy quantity per relic type
- Always show quantity badge on item/equip slots (count visible even at 1)
- XGP save picker (`pick_xgp_world`, `_load_xgp_save`) filters invalid saves via Level+LevelMeta+LocalData directory check
- Fixed `validate_xgp_save` `idx_path` resolution in `_load_xgp_save`
- `find_valid_saves` extracted as module-level function in `game_pass_save_fix.py`, reused in `restore_map.py`
- Theme/style consistency fixes for input dialogs
- Bumped version to `2.0.6`

#2.0.5
- `palsav` — fix `SetProperty` parsing + add missing type hint for `ValidatedStartPointIds`
- Pal editor — apply passive stat modifiers (MaxHP) to display and save writes
- Pal editor — scale current HP by passive multiplier for display consistency
- Breeding formula — align with palcalc: ceiling average for odd sums (`floor((A+B+1)/2)`)
- Update checker — use GitHub releases API instead of hardcoded `APP_VERSION`

#2.0.4
- Linux builds now produce a portable AppImage instead of a raw onefile binary
- Discord notifications upgraded to rich embeds with GitHub and Nexus Mods links
